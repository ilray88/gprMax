As before, the source and receiver are offset by 40mm from each other as before but they are now shifted to a starting position for the scan. The ``#src_steps`` command is used to move every source in the model by specified steps each time the model is run. Similarly, the ``#rx_steps`` command is used to move every receiver in the model by specified steps each time the model is run. Note, the same functionality can be achieved by using a block of Python code in the input file to move the source and receiver individually (for further details see the Python section of the User Guide)."
